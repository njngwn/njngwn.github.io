# Graph

## Basics

* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): directed graph which does not contain any cycles

## Graph Traverse

### Depth Fisrt Search (DFS)

### Breadth Fisrt Search (BFS)

### Topological Sort (TS)

* For a directed graph G = (V , E ), a topological order is an assignment o : V → N such that for all (u, v) ∈ E, we have o(u) < o(v).
* Topological order exists if and only if graph is acyclic, i.e. DAG




## Minimum Spanning Tree

### Kruskal’s algorithm

### Prim's algorithm
