# Graph

## Basics

* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): directed graph which does not contain any cycles

## Graph Traverse

### Depth Fisrt Search (DFS)

### Breadth Fisrt Search (BFS)

### Topological Sort (TS)

* For a directed graph G = (V, E), a topological order is an assignment o: V → N such that for all (u, v) ∈ E, we have o(u) < o(v).
* Topological order exists if and only if graph is acyclic, i.e. DAG

#### Algorithm

#### Implementation using DFS

## Strongly Connected Component(SCC) Discovery

### Algorithm

1. Tarjan's SCC Discovery
2. Using DFS


## Minimum Spanning Tree

* A minimum spanning tree connects all the vertices in the graph, ensuring that there is a path between any pair of nodes.

### Spanning Tree

* Spanning trees only exist for connected graphs, otherwise a spanning tree exists for each connected component.
* All spanning trees of a graph have the same number of edges.
