## About This Blog


Welcome! This blog is my personal space for documenting my learning journey as a developer. The name "TIL" stands for **Today I Learned**, and that's exactly what this is about: a daily log of the new concepts, techniques, and solutions I discover.


My goal is to solidify my knowledge through writing. By explaining a concept in my own words, I can ensure I truly understand it. This blog serves as a personal knowledge base that I can refer back to, as well as a way to share useful insights with others who might be on a similar path.
